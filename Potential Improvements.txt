Summary of Findings:

1. The stress test revealed several performance challenges:

2. High response times were observed when the system was under heavy load.

3. Potential server bottlenecks became apparent as user load increased.

4. Error rates showed a tendency to spike under higher concurrency.

5. Throughput plateaued after reaching a certain user threshold, indicating backend saturation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Potential Bottlenecks:

1. Server Processing Time:
 
Significant increase in response times as the number of users rose.

2. Database Latency:

Fund Transfer operations heavily relied on database transactions, leading to slower performance.

3. Error Rate:

Likelihood of 4xx and 5xx errors increased during peak loads.

4. Throughput Limit:

Throughput did not scale proportionally with the increase in user count.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suggested Improvements:

1. Backend Optimization:

2. Increase the database connection pool size to handle more concurrent operations.

3. Optimize SQL queries to ensure faster database responses.

4. Implement asynchronous processing for fund transfer operations wherever feasible.

5. Infrastructure Enhancements:

6. Introduce load balancing mechanisms to distribute the traffic across multiple servers.

7. Configure auto-scaling policies in the cloud environment to adapt to load variations.

Application Code Improvements:

1. Implement robust error handling mechanisms for invalid user inputs.

2. Validate all user inputs at the frontend and API gateway level to prevent invalid requests from reaching the server.
